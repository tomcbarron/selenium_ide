Useful selenium IDE scripts - javascript mostly

For quick GUI testing, Selenium IDE is very convenient. I'll run my scripts at the beginning of every day to verify all is well. While not as robust as the full server version, the IDE version is a good tool for product managers/BAs like myself as it is really easy to just add onto Firefox and can be learned quickly. 

The hard part is learning how to create good test data so that your datasets in your dev and uat environments look legit. Selenium IDE lets you use javascript and store the outputs as variables. Using this concept, I've created some frequently used scripts over last couple years. Instead of randomly generating names like "ADFOIJEOF", I now pull a random first name from a list of 40 first names and a random last name from 40 last names. This results in a decent looking dataset. Hope you find them useful as well.
